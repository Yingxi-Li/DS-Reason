Across the galaxy, a network of planets is linked by ancient space tunnels. Each planet is a node in this web and contains unique amenities — fueling ports, science stations, or repair bays. A Star Courier must travel from a designated starting planet to a final destination through the space tunnels. Along the way, they must also visit required waypoints, each identified by the amenities it offers. The courier navigates the galaxy using depth-first search, always choosing the next planet with the alphabetically smallest name when faced with options.
The star chart shows a galaxy-wide network of planets, each with its own amenities: fuel stops, data relays, or trade hubs. The planets are connected via space tunnels. A courier is dispatched with a route that begins at one planet and ends at another, but along the way, they must pass through planets containing required amenities — these are the waypoints. The courier follows a depth-first path, always exploring deeply first and resolving ties by selecting the planet with the alphabetically smallest name.
In this mission, you control a Star Courier navigating an interplanetary network. Planets offer specific amenities, and tunnels allow travel between them. Your task is to start at the given planet, reach your goal, and ensure you visit every required waypoint — planets chosen based on the amenities needed for the mission. Use depth-first search, going as deep as possible before backtracking, and visit neighbors in increasing alphabetical order when choosing paths.
The galaxy is stitched together by space tunnels that link distant planets. Each world contains something useful — a medbay, a fuel station, a lab. A Star Courier begins their path from one planet and must reach a distant destination. But there’s a catch: they must stop at planets with required amenities along the way. These waypoints are essential to the journey. The courier explores using depth-first search, and always picks the next smallest-named planet when several paths are open.
In this mission, a Star Courier must chart a course from a source planet to a destination, traveling through a galactic network where planets are connected via space tunnels. Each planet offers amenities, and some are designated as waypoints — planets that must be visited because of what they provide. The courier follows depth-first search, selecting the smallest neighbor according to their name first at each decision point.
